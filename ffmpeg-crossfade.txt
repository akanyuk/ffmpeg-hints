This is how I did :

    ffmpeg version N-77197-gdf2ce13
    2 videos of 4 seconds each.
    Need to join it with fade between them.
    videos are 25 fps.


1) Add fade out (light to dark) at the end of the 1st and fade in (dark to light) at the beggining of the 2nd:

ffmpeg -i 1.mp4 -y -vf fade=out:76:24 1f.mp4

ffmpeg -i 2.mp4 -y -vf fade=in:0:25 2f.mp4

76:24 mean the fade out will start frame 76 and will finish 24 frames later = 1s fade out.

0:25 mean the fade in will start frame 0 and will finish 25 frames later.


2) Merge the 2 videos

Convert all to TS

ffmpeg -i 1f.mp4 -c copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -f mpegts 1f.ts

ffmpeg -i 2f.mp4 -c copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -f mpegts 2f.ts

Merge

ffmpeg -i "concat:1f.ts|2f.ts" -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -c copy output.mp4
